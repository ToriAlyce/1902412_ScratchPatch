                <p style={{fontSize:'20px',padding:'1%'}}>
                As for my creative reflection, overall I am disappointed with everything. It has been very difficult for me trying to 
                understand and implement react and I was unable to make anything really work in order to depict my vision for my site. 
                There is so much I wanted to do but was unable to and in that, I have disappointed myself. 
                </p>
                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                In future iterations of my website, I plan to make the overall site a lot better and actually look and function like a website. 
                I plan to either make the scratch patch element as a main feature on every page or just deploy it on my internet artwork page. 
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                I would also enjoy being able to implement animations of getting the ticket stubs to roll when the player navigates to a new 
                page as if the website is generating the tickets for them. This I feel would add more juice to the website as well as incorporate 
                the theme. 
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                However, if I don't use the scratch feature on every page I then plan to design a very clean simple overall main website with 
                all block posts and everything posted neatly and in a very modern website design. I would then have the scratch tickets and 
                their roll ability on the internet artwork page, highlighting the feature there, instead of incorporating it throughout my site. 
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                There is so much I could have done and created, and I really hope ill be able to redeem this website in the final exam 
                assessment. Again I apologise for the very plain style of my current site, I added the gradient in order to just make it easier 
                to read all the information. However, It is nowhere near what I would have liked it to be.
