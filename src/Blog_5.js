                I hope this counts as a close reading, it was easy to understand I was pressed for time. If it does not count I will do another 
                one to make up for it.

                This blog post looks at RIP Adobe Flash: Five TakeawaysAbout the Plug-in’s Legacy in NetArt by McNamara. Discussing what it means 
                that adobe flash is now gone as well as looking at the artists that like to commemorate the possibilities and tools adobe flash gave them, 
                starting many people's digital hobbies and careers and lastaly how flash should be preserved as it adds to media archeology.

                The main reason why flash was discontinued was due to other software developing faster as flash became obsolete and harder to 
                use, especially on mobile devices. Thus the 2007 release of the original iPhone 2G, did not support flash as it was seen as 
                it was a proprietary product (not open standard), had poor security, and was designed for desktop, not touch. This 
                emergence of open standards led many developers to embrace HTML5 (McNamara, 2020).

                “Flash let us dream what we wanted the internet to look like,” remarked Nathalie Lawhead and “Myself as a practicing digital 
                artist, one of my first art communities that was the most impactful for me as a teen growing up with a dial-up connection 
                was Flash games, but specifically websites built with Flash that you could draw on. I spent so long just drawing back and 
                forth with people online,” explains Bluemke
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                These comments just show that Flash was significant because it was an accessible software tool that was important to 
                digital artists coming of age online. Nathalie and many other artists feel the same as they started their design careers 
                through flash and many people enjoyed using the program to create things from animations to gifs, to game sprites, 
                and many more. This adds more reason as to why flash should be commemorated and have accessible archives as it was a 
                starting point for so many as it was a stepping stone in the digital age making it an important part of history in the 
                artistic and digital world.

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                This open-source tool can also preserve your old Flash-based Art Website or Game. One of the main reasons flash had so 
                many supporters was due to the archival properties it had. Old flash games and artworks could still be accessed, viewed, 
                and played. This leads me to think of media archeology and how flash is one example of an older form of digital 
                technology preserving an era of digital art that should be saved and kept alive in this archive as we can look back and 
                see how the digital art industry has changed throughout the years.

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                Overall, I feel saddened for the digital artists of the flash era as I can imagine how devastated I would be if one of my 
                main art creating programs was such down (Like photoshop). I do feel though that this highlights a very important issue 
                that most software and programs face, that they all need a dedicated fan base of users as well as constant maintenance in 
                order to keep up with evolving technology. As no matter what we do, we are always growing and developing especially online, 
                but it is equally as important to create these digital archives. As this can allow for us to be able to go back many years 
                and see how far we have developed in the digital era.
