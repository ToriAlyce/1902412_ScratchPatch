                In this critical analysis, I will be analysing Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. article On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis. I found this article very interesting as it is not trying to define decolonization or provide ways in which we can liberate ourselves from America’s colonial rule. Instead, Mignolo and Walsh discuss the necessity of implementing decolonisation and why it has affected the globe in terms of dictating the norms and standards for the world.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                What Mignolo and Walsh are trying to do is focus on Relationality and how we as a society can integrate the ideas and thoughts passed to us through decolonization and merge our own world perspectives, ideas, and thoughts. This is what I find so interesting about the reading as I personally believe this is the best way forward in terms of gaining global knowledge and not following a set standard by one global power. It is extremely obvious of the racist, sexist and cultural ideas that we are trying to separate from in decolonization but now it is time to focus on relationality and how we as humans need to rationalize our thinking and incorporate more layers of thought and idea from all across the globe. I believe that the Global North does have a fair amount of understanding and ideas that are beneficial to society, however, I believe that across the world there are so many more diverse races, cultures, and ways of thinking that are important and some curtail that are just being overlooked and by the Global North and that is what we need to focus on changing. We need to incorporate all ideas and views in order to see the full picture of the state our world and society are in.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                In terms of relationality Mignolo and Walsh do not mean that there is only one way to do or conceive decoloniality, relationality also does not mean to just include other practices and concepts into our own. It means to reference all the global thoughts, ideas, practices, and concepts, integrating them all to greater in a way that benefits everyone and promotes the common good for society.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                “The aim of the series is to make accessible —through short, single- and/or coauthored texts, and edited collections— reflections on decoloniality from diferent continents, territories, and geographies; from diferent geobody sto-rytellings, histories, herstories, and transtories; and from diferent translo-cal subjectivities, struggles, worldviews, and world senses, most especially of those who have lived—and live—the colonial diference.” (Mignolo. Walsh, 2018)
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                In conclusion, I really enjoyed the concept of relationality that Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. (2018) have discussed. I believe relationality is the best way to put colonial rule behind us and start to grow as a global society together instead of against each other and if we could all try incorporating relationality in our decolonization practices society would reap a great benefit in expanding all knowledge.

                This blog post looks at RIP Adobe Flash: Five TakeawaysAbout the Plug-in’s Legacy in NetArt by McNamara. Discussing what it means that adobe flash is now gone as well as looking at the artists that like to commemorate the possibilities and tools adobe flash gave them, starting many people's digital hobbies and careers and lastaly how flash should be preserved as it adds to media archeology.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                The main reason why flash was discontinued was due to other software developing faster as flash became obsolete and harder to use, especially on mobile devices. Thus the 2007 release of the original iPhone 2G, did not support flash as it was seen as it was a proprietary product (not open standard), had poor security, and was designed for desktop, not touch. This emergence of open standards led many developers to embrace HTML5 (McNamara, 2020).
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                “Flash let us dream what we wanted the internet to look like,” remarked Nathalie Lawhead and “Myself as a practicing digital artist, one of my first art communities that was the most impactful for me as a teen growing up with a dial-up connection was Flash games, but specifically websites built with Flash that you could draw on. I spent so long just drawing back and forth with people online,” explains Bluemke.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                These comments just show that Flash was significant because it was an accessible software tool that was important to digital artists coming of age online. Nathalie and many other artists feel the same as they started their design careers through flash and many people enjoyed using the program to create things from animations to gifs, to game sprites, and many more. This adds more reason as to why flash should be commemorated and have accessible archives as it was a starting point for so many as it was a stepping stone in the digital age making it an important part of history in the artistic and digital world.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                This open-source tool can also preserve your old Flash-based Art Website or Game. One of the main reasons flash had so many supporters was due to the archival properties it had. Old flash games and artworks could still be accessed, viewed, and played. This leads me to think of media archeology and how flash is one example of an older form of digital technology preserving an era of digital art that should be saved and kept alive in this archive as we can look back and see how the digital art industry has changed throughout the years.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                Overall, I feel saddened for the digital artists of the flash era as I can imagine how devastated I would be if one of my main art creating programs was such down (Like photoshop). I do feel though that this highlights a very important issue that most software and programs face, that they all need a dedicated fan base of users as well as constant maintenance in order to keep up with evolving technology. As no matter what we do, we are always growing and developing especially online, but it is equally as important to create these digital archives. As this can allow for us to be able to go back many years and see how far we have developed in the digital era.
