                For my internet artwork, I will be exploring the idea of the layers that are created on the internet and I want to use a multi-layered scratch effect to demonstrate this to the user. The layers I will be creating will be made out of collaged images that the user can scratch through as well as various links and text they will slowly be revealed as they make their way through the art piece.

                I want to link my internet artwork with the idea of Relationality discussed in the Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. article On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis reading. This is due to how I feel the layers represent the various practices, thoughts, and ideas that we globally all have and layering them in a scratch and reveal from links to Mignolo, W D. and Walsh idea of taking pieces of each countries knowledge and incorporating them together in order to for greater world knowledge and understanding, instead of just from one particular point of view.

                All material used for this project will be edited and arranged uniquely by me as I will collage the layers out of various images and resources.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                The main technical concern I have is getting the multi-layered scratch patch feature to work functionally so that the user is able to endlessly scratch away and reveal layers that are also embedded with links and text. I am also a bit concerned about how I am going to fully represent the idea of Relationality in decolonization with my overall artwork.

                For my internet artwork, as I was unable to build anything I have nothing to show for this project. However, I have plans for future implementation that I really hope will make this project bounce back and be something I am proud of.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                I am not sure on how I want the overall design and layout for my website to look yet if I want my interactive scratch feature to be implemented on all pages like before or for it just to be the main focus of my internet artwork piece.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                However for my internet artwork, I would like to try design, firstly, my own multi-layered scratch patch, layered in links I find interesting along with images and pictures I enjoy and want to display in my layers. From that, I then want to be able to give the user the ability to create their own multi-layered phots in the scratch feature. I have been researching how to get an image to be uploaded and displayed to the user on a webpage and I think that I might be able to get it to work. This I think would be such a nice element to add to my site, as I will let the users be able to share it with their friends and see what they have created. Giving them the ability to play with this layered effect and come up with their own special designs.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                This may sound very difficult and I know I still have a lot need to do and get working before I can attempt to include this feature, but I will try to do as much as I can to fic and improve this site.

                <p class="p1">
                I am really happy with the final collaged piece I have made for my internet artwork. I was under a bit of pressure since I was unable to get get my scratch cards to be layered and have more than one image texture allowed to be used on them. So I had to make something that would highlight my experience of internet art and this course as a whole, the bits, and pieces that made up my experience of being in this Interactive Media course and that allowed my website and its content to be created, the relationality. I used multiple images in the collage of elements that I used or learned about from this course, I feel this links to the concepts of relationality,  spoken about by Mungolo as all these elements do not originate from the same place a lot of them are pieces that have been brought together by their relationality to the concepts and elements that we have used and gone through in this course this year.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                For the collage, I put in pieces relating to the blogs I have written such as the adobe flash grave and the images and about decolonization. I also added the various images of internet artworks we have looked at and I have written analysis on, such as Mouchette, endless horse, indirect flights, exhausting the crowd. I added the coding languages we used throughout this course as well as the Pokedex from lectures and the Wits and teams logos as that brought this course together. Lastly adding in the word relationality, as that is the driving theme in this internet artwork. 
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                Overall think this was a clever solution in order to improve and enhance my internet artwork when I could not get it to work the way I wanted. The fact that it is all compiled together in a collage I think enhances the meaning of relationality as it is an image created from collected images that bring together all the meaning and concepts that populated my website and involved in my experience of interactive media this year.
