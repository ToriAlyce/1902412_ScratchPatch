                I will be analyzing the internet artwork website pice created by Mouchette. Mouchette is a very famous internet artist who resides in Amsterdam. She struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts which she expresses on her website, by doing this she has unexpectedly generated a mass following and developed a whole community of people who struggle with similar issues of depression and suicidal thoughts.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                This has caused an unexpected mass following of people for who she has created a safe space, allowing her users to be able to express thoughts that they may not be able to express to friends and family. as well as see how many other people out in this world are going through similar pain as themselves. Being able to find and develop their own community helping them deal with their situation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                I feel as though Mouchette's page works a lot with the theoretical framework of the internet, society, and design justice as she has been able to use the internet to bring together a society of people who get to enjoy her design and have a community that supports each other.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                Overall I really enjoy Mouchette's website and admire her for putting out her own perspective and feelings on a topic such as suicide, most people are not brave enough to do that and Mouchette has though this been able to create a society and community of people that can relate to her perspective and find a safe space to express themselves as well and how they truly feel.

                Indirect Flights is a very beautiful interactive website by Joe Hamilton. It has been rendered in a google maps style, providing aerial views of around the world all cut up and fragmented into a layered panorama that plays with the viewer's perspective. The dizzying landscape, inspired by The Moving Museum, mixes images he collected while traveling in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and some images he found online. This also makes the name of the website very clever as the user has a view of looking out of an airplane but there is not really a destination below just a mix of pictures and views possible, calling it indirect flights I think is very fitting.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                As you drag your cursor around, interacting with the geographic layout design; images of deserts, beaches, forests, and industrial worlds collide. The user does not feel as though they are even in any part of the world. more like moving through a never-ending art piece.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                This piece is so captivating, I spent ages scrolling through and playing with all the generated landscapes or mish-mash of landscapes. This piece definitely does internet art justice, by being so captivating with the interactivity and existing as something that is only possible with the power of the internet and all the incredible opportunities it offers.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                I chose this artwork as it kind of deals with the same elements created in my internet artwork scratch patches, as both combine interactivity and layering of images. I hope that I am able to develop my own internet art piece to incorporate such beautiful images into my site. So that the user gets the same feeling of awe and amazement as they scratch and reveal the layers underneath each other.
