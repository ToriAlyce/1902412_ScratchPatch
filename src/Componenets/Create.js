                For this website, I wanted to bring in the concept of how vast the internet is and how many layers there are to go through. So the best kind of design I could think of was to include this was an idea of a scratch patch website that reveals more content as you scratch it away so that the user can experience an idea of many layers of the internet I am trying to represent in my website. I feel as though this is the best feature in my website as the user also gets a special kind of interactivity as they uncover the layers to my site.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                The biggest thing I struggled with was creating the overall layout and UI and UX design for my site. In the first design, I wanted to only have one page to the site that the user has to then erase through each layer of the site and view the website that way. However, I struggled a lot when it came to the overall code of this as the user currently is only able to scratch away one top layer. I also felt as though this idea was way too linear and that the user should still feel as though they are on a website and be able to navigate to the pages they want or interact with the scratch feature. This allows them more choice when the user interacts with the website.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                Therefore I finally decided on the current layout of my site, which allows much friendlier usability for the user as they interact with the site. I felt that actually displaying a ticket and having an extra navigation feature provides a much nicer display for my idea and concept and adds to the overall theme of my website. If future iterations I would like to be able to create a ticket roll animation that displays the pages that way, as I feel it will fit well with the theme of my website as well as add smoothness to the function of my site. I also would only like to incorporate the multiple layered scratch feature onto my internet artwork page as I feel as though it would incorporate nicely only in that section of my website.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                Overall I am very happy with the creative design I have developed in my website and I am very happy with the overall look and function of the site as well. I can't wait to start developing all the other features I want to incorporate in future versions of my site.

                As for my creative reflection, overall I am disappointed with everything. It has been very difficult for me trying to understand and implement react and I was unable to make anything really work in order to depict my vision for my site. There is so much I wanted to do but was unable to and in that, I have disappointed myself.

                <p class="paragraph1">
                In future iterations of my website, I plan to make the overall site a lot better and actually look and function like a website. I plan to either make the scratch patch element as a main feature on every page or just deploy it on my internet artwork page.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                I would also enjoy being able to implement animations of getting the ticket stubs to roll when the player navigates to a new page as if the website is generating the tickets for them. This I feel would add more juice to the website as well as incorporate the theme.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                However, if I don't use the scratch feature on every page I then plan to design a very clean simple overall main website with all block posts and everything posted neatly and in a very modern website design. I would then have the scratch tickets and their roll ability on the internet artwork page, highlighting the feature there, instead of incorporating it throughout my site.
                </p>

                There is so much I could have done and created, and I really hope ill be able to redeem this website in the final exam assessment. Again I apologise for the very plain style of my current site, I added the gradient in order to just make it easier to read all the information. However, It is nowhere near what I would have liked it to be.

                This is where I think my website shines, as I think I have overall created a really great concept and flow to my website based around this scratch patch theme. For the overall style of my website I wanted it to have a modernish clean look and the feature piece of the scratch card looking more old-fashioned, I think this creates a nice dynamic to my website as it still fits well together but with two contrasts working together. I also liked that the main background image of my website is a white pained brick wall as in earlier designs I thought it could be nice to have things written on the wall. This worked out as in the final iteration of the site this is how I decided to display my blogs posts.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                I was quite upset that I was not able to get the scratch card feature to work properly on all pages of the site. This is a pity because I feel like the older site brought my concepts together perfectly and made the site more enjoyable as there was constant interactivity needed throughout the whole site.  However, think I have still managed to make my site look cohesive and still highlight the scratch patch theme of my website, and showcase my internet artwork with the scratch feature by it being only on the internet art page. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                For the rest of the style of my site, I kept the scratch theme on the home, about, and blog list pages of my site, they still look as though they are on scratch cards but ones that have already been scratched open as it allows the scratch card theme to be a strong aspect of my website. For the blog pages, before, being displayed in scratch cards they were a bit hard to read so I decided to just have them printed on the brick wall of my website's background, so they still fit in with the theme and on the site but have their own separate space where they are easy to read. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                Overall, I am the happiest with the creative elements of my project and I think the creativity makes the site stand out and be enticing to the user. There are a lot of elements I would have loved to have work like multiple scratch layers to my internet artwork, ticket animation reels, and more interactivity throughout the site but I think I have made something really cool with the skills I have so I am super proud of how it turned out.
