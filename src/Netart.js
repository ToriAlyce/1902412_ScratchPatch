                <h1 style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent:'center', alignItems:'center', height: '5vh', fontSize:'35px', textAlign:'center'}}>Internet Artwork</h1>
                <p style={{fontSize:'20px',padding:'1%'}}>
                For my internet artwork, as I was unable to build anything I have nothing to show for this project. However, I have plans 
                for future implementation that I really hope will make this project bounce back and be something I am proud of.
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                I am not sure on how I want the overall design and layout for my website to look yet if I want my interactive scratch 
                feature to be implemented on all pages like before or for it just to be the main focus of my internet artwork piece. 
                </p>
                
                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                However for my internet artwork, I would like to try design, firstly, my own multi-layered scratch patch, layered in links 
                I find interesting along with images and pictures I enjoy and want to display in my layers.
                From that, I then want to be able to give the user the ability to create their own multi-layered phots in 
                the scratch feature. I have been researching how to get an image to be uploaded and displayed to the user on a 
                webpage and I think that I might be able to get it to work. This I think would be such a nice element to add to my 
                site, as I will let the users be able to share it with their friends and see what they have created. Giving them the 
                ability to play with this layered effect and come up with their own special designs. 
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                This may sound very difficult and I know I still have a lot need to do and get working before I can attempt to include 
                this feature, but I will try to do as much as I can to fic and improve this site.
