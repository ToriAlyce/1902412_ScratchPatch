                <p style={{fontSize:'20px',padding:'1%'}}>
                I will be analyzing the internet artwork website pice created by Mouchette. Mouchette is a very famous internet artist who 
            resides in Amsterdam. She struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts which she expresses on her website, by doing this 
            she has unexpectedly generated a mass following and developed a whole community of people who struggle with similar issues of 
            depression and suicidal thoughts.
                </p>
                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                This has caused an unexpected mass following of people for who she has created a safe space, allowing her users to be able 
            to express thoughts that they may not be able to express to friends and family. as well as see how many other people out in 
            this world are going through similar pain as themselves. Being able to find and develop their own community helping them
            deal with their situation.
                </p>
                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                I feel as though Mouchette's page works a lot with the theoretical framework of the internet, society, and design justice 
            as she has been able to use the internet to bring together a society of people who get to enjoy her design and have a 
            community that supports each other.
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                Overall I really enjoy Mouchette's website and admire her for putting out her own perspective and feelings on a topic such 
            as suicide, most people are not brave enough to do that and Mouchette has though this been able to create a society and 
            community of people that can relate to her perspective and find a safe space to express themselves as well and how they 
            truly feel.
                </p>
