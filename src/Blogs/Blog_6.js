                Indirect Flights is a very beautiful interactive website by Joe Hamilton. It has been rendered in a google maps style, 
                providing aerial views of around the world all cut up and fragmented into a layered panorama that plays with the viewer's 
                perspective. The dizzying landscape, inspired by The Moving Museum, mixes images he collected while traveling in Europe, 
                the Middle East, and Asia and some images he found online. This also makes the name of the website very clever as the user 
                has a view of looking out of an airplane but there is not really a destination below just a mix of pictures and views 
                possible, calling it indirect flights I think is very fitting.

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                As you drag your cursor around,  interacting with the geographic layout design; images of deserts, beaches, forests, and 
                industrial worlds collide. The user does not feel as though they are even in any part of the world. more like moving through 
                a never-ending art piece.

                This piece is so captivating, I spent ages scrolling through and playing with all the generated landscapes or mish-mash of 
                landscapes. This piece definitely does internet art justice, by being so captivating with the interactivity and existing as 
                something that is only possible with the power of the internet and all the incredible opportunities it offers. 
                </p>

                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>
                I chose this artwork as it kind of deals with the same elements created in my internet artwork scratch patches, as both 
                combine interactivity and layering of images. I hope that I am able to develop my own internet art piece to incorporate 
                such beautiful images into my site. So that the user gets the same feeling of awe and amazement as they scratch and reveal 
                the layers underneath each other.
