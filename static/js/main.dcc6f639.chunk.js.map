Instead, Mignolo and Walsh discuss the necessity of implementing decolonisation and why it has affected \r\n                the globe in terms of dictating the norms and standards for the world. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                What Mignolo and Walsh are trying to do is focus on Relationality and how we as a society can integrate the ideas and thoughts \r\n                passed to us through decolonization and merge our own world perspectives, ideas, and thoughts. This is what I find so \r\n                interesting about the reading as I personally believe this is the best way forward in terms of gaining global knowledge \r\n                and not following a set standard by one global power. It is extremely obvious of the racist, sexist and cultural ideas \r\n                that we are trying to separate from in decolonization but now it is time to focus on relationality and how we as humans \r\n                need to rationalize our thinking and incorporate more layers of thought and idea from all across the globe. I believe that \r\n                the Global North does have a fair amount of understanding and ideas that are beneficial to society, however, I believe that \r\n                across the world there are so many more diverse races, cultures, and ways of thinking that are important and some curtail\r\n                that are just being overlooked and by the Global North and that is what we need to focus on changing. We need to incorporate \r\n                all ideas and views in order to see the full picture of the state our world and society are in.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                In terms of relationality Mignolo and Walsh do not mean that there is only one way to do or conceive decoloniality, \r\n            relationality also does not mean to just include other practices and concepts into our own. It means to reference all \r\n            the global thoughts, ideas, practices, and concepts, integrating them all to greater in a way that benefits everyone \r\n            and promotes the common good for society.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                “The aim of the series is to make accessible —through short, single- and/or coauthored  texts,  and  edited  \r\n            collections— reflections  on  decoloniality  from  diferent continents, territories, and geographies; from diferent \r\n            geobody sto-rytellings,  histories,  herstories,  and  transtories;  and  from  diferent  translo-cal subjectivities, \r\n            struggles, worldviews, and world senses, most especially of those who have lived—and live—the colonial diference.” \r\n            (Mignolo. Walsh, 2018)\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                In conclusion, I really enjoyed the concept of relationality that Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. (2018) have discussed. \r\n            I believe relationality is the best way to put colonial rule behind us and start to grow as a global society together \r\n            instead of against each other and if we could all try incorporating relationality in our decolonization practices society \r\n            would reap a great benefit in expanding all knowledge. \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>References</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px'}}>\r\n            Mignolo, W D.

Being able to find and develop their own community helping them\r\n            deal with their situation.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                I feel as though Mouchette's page works a lot with the theoretical framework of the internet, society, and design justice \r\n            as she has been able to use the internet to bring together a society of people who get to enjoy her design and have a \r\n            community that supports each other.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Overall I really enjoy Mouchette's website and admire her for putting out her own perspective and feelings on a topic such \r\n            as suicide, most people are not brave enough to do that and Mouchette has though this been able to create a society and \r\n            community of people that can relate to her perspective and find a safe space to express themselves as well and how they \r\n            truly feel.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>References</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px'}}>\r\n                Mouchette.org. 2021. *MOUCHETTE*.

I now needed to be able to replicate \r\n            it and get it working correctly otherwise the creative vision of my site would fall short.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                This was the main concern when it came to the technical element of my website and the main feature, \r\n            what I needed to get to work on was the scratch code. After looking at many sources online it was very \r\n            difficult for me to finally string together a code that got the scratch feature to work. It is still not \r\n            working as I would like and I would definitely try to recode it in a more functional way. This is in terms \r\n            of creating more than one scratch layer for the user to interact with, so that that they really feel as \r\n            though they are digging through the content and uncovering more layers of art as they go through the site.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                I also was struggling with how I was going to layer my content as the scratch feature does not work on the \r\n            paragraph-tagged text, as well as the user is not able to interact with the content unless the scratch card \r\n            is completely removed. That is why I needed to create a ‘Clear Card’ button so that the user can scroll down \r\n            on the content as well as click on links. Hopefully, I will soon be able to figure out a much better way of \r\n            blending the content and the scratch feature together.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Overall I feel as though I have successfully created a scratch feature that works with the current design \r\n            of my website as it allows my creative vision for my site to be able to be featured.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>References</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px'}}>\r\n                wScratchPad.js on https://github.com/websanova/wScratchPad , was where I was able to help figure \r\n            out a functioning code for my scratch feature. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Blog_3;","import React, {Component} from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Blog_4 extends Component {\r\n    render(){\r\n        return(\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1 style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent:'center', alignItems:'center', height: '5vh', fontSize:'35px', textAlign:'center'}}>Blog 3: Creative Reflection 1</h1>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px',padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                For this website, I wanted to bring in the concept of how vast the internet is and how many layers there are \r\n            to go through. So the best kind of design I could think of was to include this was an idea of a scratch patch \r\n            website that reveals more content as you scratch it away so that the user can experience an idea of many layers \r\n            of the internet I am trying to represent in my website. I feel as though this is the best feature in my website \r\n            as the user also gets a special kind of interactivity as they uncover the layers to my site.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                The biggest thing I struggled with was creating the overall layout and UI and UX design for my site. In the first \r\n            design, I wanted to only have one page to the site that the user has to then erase through each layer of the site \r\n            and view the website that way. However, I struggled a lot when it came to the overall code of this as the user \r\n            currently is only able to scratch away one top layer. I also felt as though this idea was way too linear and that \r\n            the user should still feel as though they are on a website and be able to navigate to the pages they want or interact \r\n            with the scratch feature. This allows them more choice when the user interacts with the website.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Therefore I finally decided on the current layout of my site, which allows much friendlier usability for the user as \r\n            they interact with the site. I felt that actually displaying a ticket and having an extra navigation feature provides \r\n            a much nicer display for my idea and concept and adds to the overall theme of my website. If future iterations I would \r\n            like to be able to create a ticket roll animation that displays the pages that way, as I feel it will fit well with the \r\n            theme of my website as well as add smoothness to the function of my site. I also would only like to incorporate the multiple \r\n            layered scratch feature onto my internet artwork page as I feel as though it would incorporate nicely only in that section of \r\n            my website.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Overall I am very happy with the creative design I have developed in my website and I am very happy with the overall look \r\n            and function of the site as well. I  can't wait to start developing all the other features I want to incorporate in future \r\n            versions of my site.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Blog_4;","import React, {Component} from \"react\";\r\nimport ImageOne from './Imageone';\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Blog_7 extends Component {\r\n    render(){\r\n        return(\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1 style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent:'center', alignItems:'center', height: '5vh', fontSize:'35px', textAlign:'center'}}>Blog 7: Technical Reflection 2</h1>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px',padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Overall, I am not happy with my sight.

I found a \r\n                youtube tutorial explaining how you can add an upload image option and display it, so I have to develop a way of being \r\n                able to implement that along with the scratchpad code. I don't know how it's going to go as I have struggled a lot \r\n                trying to get the scratchpad to display properly, but I feel if a go through the work properly ill be able to figure \r\n                out how to do it. \r\n                </p>\r\n                \r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                My poor time management shot me in the foot for this project and I really wish I focused more on the site and \r\n                trying to understand the lectures.

Discussing what it means \r\n                that adobe flash is now gone as well as looking at the artists that like to commemorate the possibilities and tools adobe flash gave them, \r\n                starting many people's digital hobbies and careers and lastaly how flash should be preserved as it adds to media archeology. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                The main reason why flash was discontinued was due to other software developing faster as flash became obsolete and harder to \r\n                use, especially on mobile devices. Thus the 2007 release of the original iPhone 2G, did not support flash as it was seen as \r\n                it was a proprietary product (not open standard), had poor security, and was designed for desktop, not touch. This \r\n                emergence of open standards led many developers to embrace HTML5 (McNamara, 2020).\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                “Flash let us dream what we wanted the internet to look like,” remarked Nathalie Lawhead and “Myself as a practicing digital \r\n                artist, one of my first art communities that was the most impactful for me as a teen growing up with a dial-up connection \r\n                was Flash games, but specifically websites built with Flash that you could draw on. I spent so long just drawing back and \r\n                forth with people online,” explains Bluemke\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                These comments just show that Flash was significant because it was an accessible software tool that was important to \r\n                digital artists coming of age online. Nathalie and many other artists feel the same as they started their design careers \r\n                through flash and many people enjoyed using the program to create things from animations to gifs, to game sprites, \r\n                and many more. This adds more reason as to why flash should be commemorated and have accessible archives as it was a \r\n                starting point for so many as it was a stepping stone in the digital age making it an important part of history in the \r\n                artistic and digital world.  \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                This open-source tool can also preserve your old Flash-based Art Website or Game. One of the main reasons flash had so \r\n                many supporters was due to the archival properties it had. Old flash games and artworks could still be accessed, viewed, \r\n                and played. This leads me to think of media archeology and how flash is one example of an older form of digital \r\n                technology preserving an era of digital art that should be saved and kept alive in this archive as we can look back and \r\n                see how the digital art industry has changed throughout the years.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                Overall, I feel saddened for the digital artists of the flash era as I can imagine how devastated I would be if one of my \r\n                main art creating programs was such down (Like photoshop). I do feel though that this highlights a very important issue \r\n                that most software and programs face, that they all need a dedicated fan base of users as well as constant maintenance in \r\n                order to keep up with evolving technology. As no matter what we do, we are always growing and developing especially online, \r\n                but it is equally as important to create these digital archives. As this can allow for us to be able to go back many years \r\n                and see how far we have developed in the digital era.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>References</h2>\r\n                <p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:'1%'}}>\r\n                McNamara, 2020.
