I found this article very interesting as it is not trying to define decolonization or provide ways in which we can liberate ourselves from America’s colonial rule. Instead, Mignolo and Walsh discuss the necessity of implementing decolonisation and why it has affected the globe in terms of dictating the norms and standards for the world.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                What Mignolo and Walsh are trying to do is focus on Relationality and how we as a society can integrate the ideas and thoughts passed to us through decolonization and merge our own world perspectives, ideas, and thoughts. This is what I find so interesting about the reading as I personally believe this is the best way forward in terms of gaining global knowledge and not following a set standard by one global power. It is extremely obvious of the racist, sexist and cultural ideas that we are trying to separate from in decolonization but now it is time to focus on relationality and how we as humans need to rationalize our thinking and incorporate more layers of thought and idea from all across the globe. I believe that the Global North does have a fair amount of understanding and ideas that are beneficial to society, however, I believe that across the world there are so many more diverse races, cultures, and ways of thinking that are important and some curtail that are just being overlooked and by the Global North and that is what we need to focus on changing. We need to incorporate all ideas and views in order to see the full picture of the state our world and society are in.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                In terms of relationality Mignolo and Walsh do not mean that there is only one way to do or conceive decoloniality, relationality also does not mean to just include other practices and concepts into our own. It means to reference all the global thoughts, ideas, practices, and concepts, integrating them all to greater in a way that benefits everyone and promotes the common good for society.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                “The aim of the series is to make accessible —through short, single- and/or coauthored texts, and edited collections— reflections on decoloniality from diferent continents, territories, and geographies; from diferent geobody sto-rytellings, histories, herstories, and transtories; and from diferent translo-cal subjectivities, struggles, worldviews, and world senses, most especially of those who have lived—and live—the colonial diference.” (Mignolo. Walsh, 2018)\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                In conclusion, I really enjoyed the concept of relationality that Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. (2018) have discussed. I believe relationality is the best way to put colonial rule behind us and start to grow as a global society together instead of against each other and if we could all try incorporating relationality in our decolonization practices society would reap a great benefit in expanding all knowledge.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\"><h3 class=\"paragraph1\">References</h3>\r\n                Mignolo, W D.

If it does not count I will do another one to make up for it.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                This blog post looks at RIP Adobe Flash: Five TakeawaysAbout the Plug-in’s Legacy in NetArt by McNamara. Discussing what it means that adobe flash is now gone as well as looking at the artists that like to commemorate the possibilities and tools adobe flash gave them, starting many people's digital hobbies and careers and lastaly how flash should be preserved as it adds to media archeology.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                The main reason why flash was discontinued was due to other software developing faster as flash became obsolete and harder to use, especially on mobile devices. Thus the 2007 release of the original iPhone 2G, did not support flash as it was seen as it was a proprietary product (not open standard), had poor security, and was designed for desktop, not touch. This emergence of open standards led many developers to embrace HTML5 (McNamara, 2020).\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                “Flash let us dream what we wanted the internet to look like,” remarked Nathalie Lawhead and “Myself as a practicing digital artist, one of my first art communities that was the most impactful for me as a teen growing up with a dial-up connection was Flash games, but specifically websites built with Flash that you could draw on. I spent so long just drawing back and forth with people online,” explains Bluemke.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                These comments just show that Flash was significant because it was an accessible software tool that was important to digital artists coming of age online. Nathalie and many other artists feel the same as they started their design careers through flash and many people enjoyed using the program to create things from animations to gifs, to game sprites, and many more. This adds more reason as to why flash should be commemorated and have accessible archives as it was a starting point for so many as it was a stepping stone in the digital age making it an important part of history in the artistic and digital world.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                This open-source tool can also preserve your old Flash-based Art Website or Game. One of the main reasons flash had so many supporters was due to the archival properties it had. Old flash games and artworks could still be accessed, viewed, and played. This leads me to think of media archeology and how flash is one example of an older form of digital technology preserving an era of digital art that should be saved and kept alive in this archive as we can look back and see how the digital art industry has changed throughout the years.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Overall, I feel saddened for the digital artists of the flash era as I can imagine how devastated I would be if one of my main art creating programs was such down (Like photoshop). I do feel though that this highlights a very important issue that most software and programs face, that they all need a dedicated fan base of users as well as constant maintenance in order to keep up with evolving technology. As no matter what we do, we are always growing and developing especially online, but it is equally as important to create these digital archives. As this can allow for us to be able to go back many years and see how far we have developed in the digital era.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\"><h3 class=\"paragraph1\">References</h3>\r\n                McNamara, 2020.

So the best kind of design I could think of was to include this was an idea of a scratch patch website that reveals more content as you scratch it away so that the user can experience an idea of many layers of the internet I am trying to represent in my website. I feel as though this is the best feature in my website as the user also gets a special kind of interactivity as they uncover the layers to my site.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                The biggest thing I struggled with was creating the overall layout and UI and UX design for my site. In the first design, I wanted to only have one page to the site that the user has to then erase through each layer of the site and view the website that way. However, I struggled a lot when it came to the overall code of this as the user currently is only able to scratch away one top layer. I also felt as though this idea was way too linear and that the user should still feel as though they are on a website and be able to navigate to the pages they want or interact with the scratch feature. This allows them more choice when the user interacts with the website.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Therefore I finally decided on the current layout of my site, which allows much friendlier usability for the user as they interact with the site. I felt that actually displaying a ticket and having an extra navigation feature provides a much nicer display for my idea and concept and adds to the overall theme of my website. If future iterations I would like to be able to create a ticket roll animation that displays the pages that way, as I feel it will fit well with the theme of my website as well as add smoothness to the function of my site. I also would only like to incorporate the multiple layered scratch feature onto my internet artwork page as I feel as though it would incorporate nicely only in that section of my website.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Overall I am very happy with the creative design I have developed in my website and I am very happy with the overall look and function of the site as well. I can't wait to start developing all the other features I want to incorporate in future versions of my site.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Creative Reflection 2</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                As for my creative reflection, overall I am disappointed with everything. It has been very difficult for me trying to understand and implement react and I was unable to make anything really work in order to depict my vision for my site. There is so much I wanted to do but was unable to and in that, I have disappointed myself.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                In future iterations of my website, I plan to make the overall site a lot better and actually look and function like a website. I plan to either make the scratch patch element as a main feature on every page or just deploy it on my internet artwork page.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                I would also enjoy being able to implement animations of getting the ticket stubs to roll when the player navigates to a new page as if the website is generating the tickets for them. This I feel would add more juice to the website as well as incorporate the theme.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                However, if I don't use the scratch feature on every page I then plan to design a very clean simple overall main website with all block posts and everything posted neatly and in a very modern website design. I would then have the scratch tickets and their roll ability on the internet artwork page, highlighting the feature there, instead of incorporating it throughout my site.\r\n                </p>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                There is so much I could have done and created, and I really hope ill be able to redeem this website in the final exam assessment. Again I apologise for the very plain style of my current site, I added the gradient in order to just make it easier to read all the information. However, It is nowhere near what I would have liked it to be.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Creative Reflection 3</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                This is where I think my website shines, as I think I have overall created a really great concept and flow to my website based around this scratch patch theme. For the overall style of my website I wanted it to have a modernish clean look and the feature piece of the scratch card looking more old-fashioned, I think this creates a nice dynamic to my website as it still fits well together but with two contrasts working together. I also liked that the main background image of my website is a white pained brick wall as in earlier designs I thought it could be nice to have things written on the wall. This worked out as in the final iteration of the site this is how I decided to display my blogs posts.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                I was quite upset that I was not able to get the scratch card feature to work properly on all pages of the site. This is a pity because I feel like the older site brought my concepts together perfectly and made the site more enjoyable as there was constant interactivity needed throughout the whole site.  However, think I have still managed to make my site look cohesive and still highlight the scratch patch theme of my website, and showcase my internet artwork with the scratch feature by it being only on the internet art page. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                For the rest of the style of my site, I kept the scratch theme on the home, about, and blog list pages of my site, they still look as though they are on scratch cards but ones that have already been scratched open as it allows the scratch card theme to be a strong aspect of my website. For the blog pages, before, being displayed in scratch cards they were a bit hard to read so I decided to just have them printed on the brick wall of my website's background, so they still fit in with the theme and on the site but have their own separate space where they are easy to read. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Overall, I am the happiest with the creative elements of my project and I think the creativity makes the site stand out and be enticing to the user. There are a lot of elements I would have loved to have work like multiple scratch layers to my internet artwork, ticket animation reels, and more interactivity throughout the site but I think I have made something really cool with the skills I have so I am super proud of how it turned out.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </section>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Create\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport \"../css/Tech.css\"\r\n\r\nexport class Tech extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <section class=\"white\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head2 headdiv\">Technical Reflection 1</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1 marg\">\r\n                The technical element to my website's overall design was the most crucial as I had come up with the creative design and layout first before I began to build my site. I now needed to be able to replicate it and get it working correctly otherwise the creative vision of my site would fall short.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                This was the main concern when it came to the technical element of my website and the main feature, what I needed to get to work on was the scratch code. After looking at many sources online it was very difficult for me to finally string together a code that got the scratch feature to work. It is still not working as I would like and I would definitely try to recode it in a more functional way. This is in terms of creating more than one scratch layer for the user to interact with, so that that they really feel as though they are digging through the content and uncovering more layers of art as they go through the site.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                I also was struggling with how I was going to layer my content as the scratch feature does not work on the paragraph-tagged text, as well as the user is not able to interact with the content unless the scratch card is completely removed. That is why I needed to create a ‘Clear Card’ button so that the user can scroll down on the content as well as click on links. Hopefully, I will soon be able to figure out a much better way of blending the content and the scratch feature together.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Overall I feel as though I have successfully created a scratch feature that works with the current design of my website as it allows my creative vision for my site to be able to be featured.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\"><h3 class=\"paragraph1\">References</h3>\r\n                wScratchPad.js on https://github.com/websanova/wScratchPad , was where I was able to help figure out a functioning code for my scratch feature.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Technical Reflection 2</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Overall, I am not happy with my sight. I struggled with the technical application and how React works and how I am supposed to link everything together. I can't get images to display, my pc was really struggling to build the react app so I was only able to get it to work and push it to GitHub on Tuesday morning (9th of Nov). So I need to go back and properly sit and interact with Andres Lectures as I did not grasp how to implement everything properly as I did not give myself enough time to go through the work and learn.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                As for future implementation (This site will bounce back, ill show you, I can make it work!) I have a lot planned that I would have loved this site to be like, still sticking to my original Scratch Patch site from assignment one, I want to make the same site but enhance it and improve it based on the feedback received for assignment one.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                Such as making the site more responsive to different screen sizes, changing the backgrounds used for the scratch pads as they make the words difficult to read. Adding animations into the site as well as making a better navbar for the user.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                As for my Internet artwork, I have a new idea of letting the user upload the images and layer them themselves to be scratched away, possible then be able to share their own layered scratch pads with friends and family. I found a youtube tutorial explaining how you can add an upload image option and display it, so I have to develop a way of being able to implement that along with the scratchpad code. I don't know how it's going to go as I have struggled a lot trying to get the scratchpad to display properly, but I feel if a go through the work properly ill be able to figure out how to do it.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                My poor time management shot me in the foot for this project and I really wish I focused more on the site and trying to understand the lectures. This is very embarrassing and I apologise for not doing better, I will improve by the next assignment.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Technical Reflection 3</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                The technical element is the part of the project I struggled with the most, as I am not the best coder out there. I only started coding in my 2nd year at Wits, so every coding language or framework is a new challenge for me. Overall, I am pleased that I at least got my navigation of the website working well and still can showcase concepts of my original Scratch Patch website.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                The first biggest challenge of using React.js was trying to get the scratch patch feature to work on the website. The original code didn't work as it had on my previous site, so I had to look for other resources, eventually finding one that works almost as well. However, I could not get this new code to allow me to add different images to each scratch patch layer. I experimented with adding separate divs and trying to separate the code and scratch cards into individual components. But, I could not get any of this to work, so I made the design decision to have my scratch patch interaction feature only on the internet artwork page. As for the rest of my site, I tried to still include the scratch patch theme into all parts of my website to make it look cohesive. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                In terms of responsiveness, that is where my site is technically lacking again, it works well on a normal laptop screen but, I could not get it to function properly on different screen sizes. I had trouble getting media queries to work properly to make it responsive and after a while decided to leave them out of the project altogether. I know that using a % when sizing code helps it respond better on different screens so I tried to use % as much as possible. My scratch patch cards, however, did not work well in being responsive as I had to use px in some areas of code or the scratch patch would break.  I am concerned about it as I was not able to fix the responsiveness and it ruins the overall scratch card illusion if it is not aligned properly, messing with the presentation of my internet artwork. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                I'll end this technical reflection on a more positive note, I am very happy that I got an overall better understanding of how React.js works and how to use it compared to my Assignment 2 submission. I am very proud I was able to recreate the basics of my initial scratch patch website again in my react application. As well as at least getting my internet artwork's scratch card to work. Overall I think I learned a lot by working on this project and know that with more practice I'll get the hang of React.js. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </section>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tech\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport \"../css/Artwork.css\"\r\n\r\nexport class Artwork extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <section class=\"white\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head2 headdiv\">Mouchette Artwork Analysis 1</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1 marg\">\r\n                I will be analyzing the internet artwork website pice created by Mouchette.

The dizzying landscape, inspired by The Moving Museum, mixes images he collected while traveling in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and some images he found online. This also makes the name of the website very clever as the user has a view of looking out of an airplane but there is not really a destination below just a mix of pictures and views possible, calling it indirect flights I think is very fitting.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"paragraph1\">\r\n                As you drag your cursor around, interacting with the geographic layout design; images of deserts, beaches, forests, and industrial worlds collide.

I am also a bit concerned about how I am going to fully represent the idea of Relationality in decolonization with my overall artwork.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Revised Internet Artwork Description</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                For my internet artwork, as I was unable to build anything I have nothing to show for this project. However, I have plans for future implementation that I really hope will make this project bounce back and be something I am proud of.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                I am not sure on how I want the overall design and layout for my website to look yet if I want my interactive scratch feature to be implemented on all pages like before or for it just to be the main focus of my internet artwork piece.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                However for my internet artwork, I would like to try design, firstly, my own multi-layered scratch patch, layered in links I find interesting along with images and pictures I enjoy and want to display in my layers. From that, I then want to be able to give the user the ability to create their own multi-layered phots in the scratch feature. I have been researching how to get an image to be uploaded and displayed to the user on a webpage and I think that I might be able to get it to work. This I think would be such a nice element to add to my site, as I will let the users be able to share it with their friends and see what they have created. Giving them the ability to play with this layered effect and come up with their own special designs.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                This may sound very difficult and I know I still have a lot need to do and get working before I can attempt to include this feature, but I will try to do as much as I can to fic and improve this site.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                <h1 class=\"head3 headdiv\">Final Internet Artwork Rationale</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                I am really happy with the final collaged piece I have made for my internet artwork. I was under a bit of pressure since I was unable to get get my scratch cards to be layered and have more than one image texture allowed to be used on them. So I had to make something that would highlight my experience of internet art and this course as a whole, the bits, and pieces that made up my experience of being in this Interactive Media course and that allowed my website and its content to be created, the relationality. I used multiple images in the collage of elements that I used or learned about from this course, I feel this links to the concepts of relationality,  spoken about by Mungolo as all these elements do not originate from the same place a lot of them are pieces that have been brought together by their relationality to the concepts and elements that we have used and gone through in this course this year.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                For the collage, I put in pieces relating to the blogs I have written such as the adobe flash grave and the images and about decolonization. I also added the various images of internet artworks we have looked at and I have written analysis on, such as Mouchette, endless horse, indirect flights, exhausting the crowd. I added the coding languages we used throughout this course as well as the Pokedex from lectures and the Wits and teams logos as that brought this course together. Lastly adding in the word relationality, as that is the driving theme in this internet artwork. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p class=\"p1\">\r\n                Overall think this was a clever solution in order to improve and enhance my internet artwork when I could not get it to work the way I wanted. The fact that it is all compiled together in a collage I think enhances the meaning of relationality as it is an image created from collected images that bring together all the meaning and concepts that populated my website and involved in my experience of interactive media this year.\r\n                </p>  \r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Reflections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    ","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport \"./App.css\";\r\nimport Image from './Componenets/Image';\r\n\r\n/*import Welcome from './Homepage';\r\nimport Intro from './introduction';\r\nimport Blog_1 from './Blog_1';\r\nimport Blog_2 from './Blog_2';\r\nimport Blog_3 from './Blog_3';\r\nimport Blog_4 from './Blog_4';\r\nimport Blog_7 from './Blog_7';\r\nimport Blog_6 from './Blog_6';\r\nimport Blog_5 from './Blog_5';\r\nimport Netart from './Netart';\r\nimport Blog_8 from './Blog_8';\r\n\r\nimport Pokecard from './Pokecard';\r\nimport Pokedex from './Pokedex';\r\nimport Pokegame from './Pokegame';\r\nimport Navbar from './Componenets/Navbar';*/\r\nimport Title from './Title';\r\nimport { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport About from './Componenets/About';\r\nimport Art from './Componenets/Art'\r\nimport Blogs from './Componenets/Blogs.js';\r\nimport Theory from './Componenets/Theory.js';\r\nimport Create from './Componenets/Create.js';\r\nimport Tech from './Componenets/Tech.js';\r\nimport Artwork from './Componenets/Artwork.js';\r\nimport Reflections from './Componenets/Reflections.js';\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component{\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div className=\"App\">\r\n                <div id=\"Title\">\r\n                    <Title/>\r\n                </div>\r\n               <Routes>\r\n                   <Route path='/1902412_ScratchPatch' element={<Image/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/About' element={<About/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Art' element={<Art/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Blogs' element={<Blogs/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Theory' element={<Theory/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Create' element={<Create/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Tech' element={<Tech/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Artwork' element={<Artwork/>}/>\r\n                   <Route path='/Reflections' element={<Reflections/>}/>\r\n               </Routes>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n        //<Welcome/>\r\n        //<Intro/>\r\n        //<Blog_1/>\r\n        //<Blog_2/>\r\n       //<Blog_3/>\r\n        /*<Blog_4/>\r\n        <Blog_5/>\r\n        <Blog_6/>\r\n        <Blog_7/>\r\n        <Blog_8/>\r\n        <Netart/>*/\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App; ","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDom from \"react-dom\";\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport \"./index.css\";\r\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nReactDom.render(\r\n    <BrowserRouter>\r\n    <App/>\r\n    </BrowserRouter>, \r\ndocument.getElementById('root')\r\n);"],"sourceRoot":""}
